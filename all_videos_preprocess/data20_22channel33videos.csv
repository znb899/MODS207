Lyrics

This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you, caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it",Oscar Canto,2022-02-04 14:30:11+00:00,"['Katy Perry', 'I kissed A Girl', 'Single']",10,16:17,1,4,115,0,hd,False,JrFMrchOquw,0.0,0.0

#KatyPerry #HotNCold

Lyrics

You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch I would know
And you over-think always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go

You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be just like twins so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go

You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go

You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down",Oscar Canto,2022-02-04 13:54:47+00:00,"['Hot n Cold', 'Katy Perry', 'Single']",10,15:56,0,6,164,0,hd,False,XITaavPH6O8,0.0,0.0
