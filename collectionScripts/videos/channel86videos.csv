John Cage : One11 & 103,"This is John Cage's parting gift to the world. Completed 2 months before he passed.

In 1992, John Cage declined several invitations to attend celebrations marking his 80th birthday in order to devote himself to the completion of One11, the eleventh work for solo performer (hence the title) in the series of Number Pieces that occupied him during the five last years of his life. 

The performer in this case was a solo cameraman - Van Carlson - and Cage's ambitious project was nothing less than a full-length film (90 minutes) with no characters and no plot, directed by Henning Lohner and accompanied (or not as the case may be) by the orchestral work 103, which dates from September 1991. 

It's quite simply one of Cage's great works, and one of the most complex and time-consuming to realise, though as usual the basic idea was remarkably simple: use I-Ching generated chance procedures to determine the placement, angle of projection and intensity of 168 lights in an empty television studio and provide the solo cameraman with a similarly calculated score defining camera movements (a similar chance-generated working plan was subsequently devised for the editing of the film that took place in New York after the film had been shot in Germany in April 1992). 

The film consists of 17 scenes, each of which is further divided into takes, and Cage's idea was to dispense with editing as far as possible; amazingly only 600m of film were not used, and were duly pillaged to provide the visual backdrop to the opening credits. 

Andrew Culver programmed the composer's calculations into a computer which controlled the lighting changes - some 1200 of them, each featuring up to twenty different lights - and the full resources of the studio in Fernseh Studio Munchen were at Cage's disposal.

The film is accompanied by 103, created quite independently of One11.

The Making of John Cage's One11,"The making of John Cage's 11th piece for one performer (One 11).

The 90-minute film of One11 was the major project of Cage's final years and was completed just three months before his death in 1992. When asked why he took on something new in the medium of film, Cage said he jumped at the opportunity because there wasn't much time left. Sadly he was right.

The music is a seamless garment of continuous sustained sounds, with some individual notes picked out, in the style of Cage's late ""number"" pieces. There's a choice of two soundtracks that are independent, of course, from the visual images but nevertheless uncannily appropriate. Cage said the film has ""no plot, no characters, nothing"", hoping it would ""give pleasure without having any meaning whatsoever"". He wanted it to be ""free of politics, economics and even of oneself"". The documentary material with the DVD shows that the film was elaborate to make: there are 17 scenes requiring 1,200 cues with 20 light-changes each - all indicated in charts for the technicians derived from Cage's usual chance methods. The camera is the soloist.

These details don't explain the remarkable quality of these uniquely pure visual images, studies in light ranging from total black to total white. No colours. The play of lights brings up slowly moving circular objects eerily reminiscent of distant moons transmitted from outer space posing the eternal questions of existence. At times the scenario suggests cloud formations viewed from a plane. Cage's formulae for removing personal taste have paradoxically produced mesmeric images that only he could have devised.",Paul Mina Storm,2019-11-10T20:25:22Z,"['john cage', 'one11']",27,43:9,0,9,287,0,sd,False
